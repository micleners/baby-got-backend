## Traditional Backend: On-Prem or Hosted Servers
<br><div>TBH heard they are not fun <span style="font-size:40px;"> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<span></div>
- Must maintian solution and related processes
- Responsible for server hardware, software, power consumption, and space
- Must employ people to manage on prem servers
- Can't just upgrade to a bigger instance with a click/CLI command

There are some advantages: having control over data, potentially being able to implement better security solutions (yet this is doubtful for most companies), governmental compliance. Here's an article that does a nice [compare and contrast](https://www.cleo.com/blog/knowledge-base-on-premise-vs-cloud)

## The Emergence of Cloud Hosting - Dedicated Servers

![alt text](static/hosted_solutions.png)

## Digital Ocean
- [APS.NET Core](https://www.godo.dev/tutorials/aspnet-core-mysql-ubuntu-16-04/)
- [Django](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04)
- [Node.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-18-04)

### General Process on Digital Ocean:
- Purchase $5 droplet (server)
- SSH onto your server
- Get your application set up through git
- Set up DB appropriately
- Set up appropriate server runner (Gunicorn for Django, Kestrel in APS.NET, PM2 for Node.js)
- Set up a reverse proxy with Nginx to route domain to app
- Profit

## AWS EC2:
- [APS.NET Core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/dotnet-core-tutorial.html)
- [Django](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-django.html)
- [Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html)

## Approach to Serverless
What is serverless anyhow. I borrowed this definition from [this Medium Article](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-serverless-architecture-what-are-its-pros-and-cons-cc4b804022e9):

*"Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. A serverless application runs in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may last for one invocation), and fully managed by the cloud provider. Pricing is based on the number of executions rather than pre-purchased compute capacity"*

### AWS Lambda
- [Django (pictured below)](https://blog.lawrencemcdaniel.com/serve-a-django-app-from-an-aws-lambda-function/)
- [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-dotnet-coreclr-deployment-package.html)
- [Node.js with Express](https://dev.to/brightdevs/how-to-convert-an-express-app-to-aws-lambda--44gc)
- [Xilution Example for Serverless Node.js App](https://github.com/xilution/xilution-react-todomvc)
- [Another NodeJS (pictured below)](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/building-your-first-serverless-app-in-node-js-with-aws-lambda-s3-api-gateway-4d87e808d9cc)

## Heroku my Hero ü•∞
It makes deployment easy - Heroku takes a lot of the legwork out of the way. All possible from the command line!
Similar to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Zeit's Now.sh](https://zeit.co/now)

### Node.js Documentation on Heroku
[Heroku Tuturial for Node.js](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)

#### Personal Quest
[Twilio Quest](https://www.twilio.com/quest/u/mdevstix) while I was working on applying for a software education position with Twilio on the Twilio Quest team. Used Node.js and deployed on Heroku as found in my [Twilio Quest repo](https://github.com/micleners/twilioquest-sms).

### Note: No sanctioned ASP.NET solution on Heroku

### Django on Heroku
[Example for using Postgres with Django on Heroku](https://medium.com/@qazi/how-to-deploy-a-django-app-to-heroku-in-2018-the-easy-way-48a528d97f9c)
Deploying Django applications onto Heroku is similar to other applications:
- Place Procfile in root directory directing Gunicorn be used for deploying
- Make sure you have a requirements.txt, Pipfile or similar file declaring packages to install
- Include heroku-django settings and commands to help alleviate difficulties around static deploy
- Use Heroku CLI to push up to deploy.

Example of this can be found at the end of my [django workshop](https://github.com/micleners/django-workshop) & in the commit log

## Firebase üî•
Firebase offers a comprehensive development platform for making mobile and web apps. It is a cloud solution provided by Google. It can be used with applications for authentication, analytics, storage, databases, and beyond. We'll look at Firestore.

### I started an app named [NomTime](https://github.com/micleners/nomtime) using these tutorials:
- [How to build an SPA using Vue.js, Vuex, Vuetify, and Firebase: use Vuex and access the API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-spa-using-vue-js-vuex-vuetify-and-firebase-use-vuex-and-access-the-api-f8036aa464ad/)
- [Working an application in Vue.js with TDD](https://medium.com/magnetis-backstage/working-an-application-in-vue-js-with-tdd-an-extensive-guide-for-people-who-have-time-part-1-3be791dafa2b)
- [A Vuex Tutorial by Example - Learn Vue State Management](https://coursetro.com/posts/code/144/A-Vuex-Tutorial-by-Example---Learn-Vue-State-Management)

## NomTime App Structure
![alt text](static/bgb/nomtime-architecture.png)

## Hooking up Firebase to Vue Application (similar in other frameworks):
- Install Firebase npm package
- Initiate Firebase (in `main.js` in Vue project)
- Set up db context (point to `firebase.firestore()`)
- Use the db to get, save, update, etc

### Additionally API/Functionality Management:
- I created an action call to get data from the Edamam API service (see first tutorial above)
- I created a button called `Load Recipes` that takes the search queary, makes a request to get the top 10 results, then stores the query result to the firestore DB
- Future goal was to have a more robust user interface and functionality. See [design mock ups in repo](https://github.com/micleners/nomtime)

# Contentful: A Headless CMS
Beyond headless CMS, Contentful is the essential API-first content management infrastructure to create, manage and distribute content to any platform or device. 
[Easy start with GatsbyJS](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/gatsbyjs-and-contentful-in-five-minutes/)

## Contentful and Angular
I've just begun to play around with this, but so far I'm loving Contentful. Here's what I've done:
- Used [this contenful tutorial](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/javascript/tutorials/using-contentful-in-an-angular-project/) to load up products in publicly available space
- Created my own space with events, users and locations models (similar to [Django Workshop](https://github.com/micleners/django-workshop) API I created. You can view API endpoints [hosted on heroku](https://radiant-brushlands-99143.herokuapp.com/api/) üòâ
- Swapped out the tutorial API code with my own, updated the data models and attributes. Data loaded nicely
